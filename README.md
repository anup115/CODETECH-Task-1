**DESCRIPTION**
Creating a basic calculator program in Python involves writing a script that interacts with the user to perform simple arithmetic operations. The program should prompt the user to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). Based on the user's choice, the program will execute the corresponding mathematical operation and display the result.

**Step-by-Step Description:**
**1.User Input:**

The program starts by prompting the user to input two numbers. These numbers will be stored in variables. It is essential to ensure that the input is valid, so we should convert the input strings to float or int to handle decimal numbers and integer operations, respectively.
2.Operation Selection:

The user is then asked to choose an arithmetic operation. This can be done by presenting a menu with options such as:
1 for Addition
2 for Subtraction
3 for Multiplication
4 for Division
The user's choice is stored in a variable for further processing.
**3.Performing the Operation:**

Using conditional statements (if-elif-else), the program checks the user's choice and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation. For example:
If the user chooses addition, the program adds the two numbers.
If the user chooses subtraction, the program subtracts the second number from the first.
If the user chooses multiplication, the program multiplies the two numbers.
If the user chooses division, the program divides the first number by the second. It is important to handle division by zero by including a check and providing an appropriate message if the second number is zero.
**4.Displaying the Result:**
After performing the chosen operation, the program prints the result to the user.
**5.Error Handling:**

To make the program robust, include error handling to manage invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values or invalid operation choices. This can be achieved using try-except blocks to catch and respond to exceptions gracefully.

**CONCLUSION:**
Creating a basic calculator program in Python is an excellent introduction to fundamental programming concepts. This project involves prompting the user to enter two numbers, selecting an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), performing the selected operation, and displaying the result. Through this exercise, learners gain experience with user input, data conversion, conditional statements, arithmetic operations, and error handling. Overall, developing this simple calculator builds a solid foundation in Python programming, reinforcing essential skills needed for more advanced projects and real-world applications.
